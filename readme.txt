Welcome to the BitBenders Memory Allocation Project

Memory_allocation.cpp contains the source code of our project.

Simulation_data.txt is a output file which Memory_allocation.cpp writes to in order to provide data for data_graphs.py.

data_graphs.py creates graphical visualizations for memory utilization and memory allocation based on runtime.
    data_graphs.py requires numpy and matplotlib package installation use the following commands
        pip install numpy   
        pip install matplotlib
